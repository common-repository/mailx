MailX - Change Sender Name, Sender Address & Content Type of Your Emails

== Description ==

MailX is a REALLY simple plugin that helps you change some basic things that you don't want regarding your emails!

## ðŸ‘‰ Sender Name
By default your site uses `WordPress` as the email sender name. With MailX, you can change this to anything you want.

## ðŸ‘‰ Sender Email
Your site sends emails as wordpress@yoursite.com. You can now change this to your own email address to increase credibility.

## ðŸ‘‰ HTML Mail
The emails your WordPress site sends does not "execute" HTML code it may contain. MailX made it possible to change your email content type to HTML instead of the plain texts.


== Installation ==

1. Install MailX using the native Plugin installer, or download the zip and extract it in the wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the â€˜Pluginsâ€™ admin menu.
3. Configure from the settings page
